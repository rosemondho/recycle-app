## Project Proposal

### Overview

A app where users can determine if their plastic can be recycled, and the nearest recyclers.

### Technologies required (besides typical Hackbright tech stack)

- The Earth911 API: https://www.programmableweb.com/api/earth911-search

### Data

- Number of plastic recycling symbol
- ZIP Code
- Number of Results
- Radius of Search
- [optional] Materials to Recycle


### Roadmap

#### MVP

- Users can search based on ZIP code and materials.
- Users can get a list of search results for nearby recyclers based on the criteria.
- Users can create and login to an account.
- Logged-in users can like and/or comment on different recyclers.
- Users can see a list of all recycleable materials.

#### 2.0

- Upload a photo of the plastic recycling symbol and have it self-identify what the number is

#### 3.0

- Add on Twilio to text users the address of the recycler
- Add on CO2 footprint of traveling to recycler.
